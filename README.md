# Docker Installation and Setup Script
This project provides a shell script that automates the complete installation and setup of Docker on Ubuntu/Debian systems.

It covers:

Installing Docker and its dependencies.

Adding the current user to the docker group (to avoid using sudo for Docker commands).

Starting and enabling the Docker service to run at system startup.

# ðŸ“œ Script Name
Recommended script filename:

bash

install_docker.sh
Clear, descriptive, and follows standard naming conventions for shell scripts.

# ðŸ›  What the Script Does
Updates the system package index.

Installs required dependencies (ca-certificates, curl, gnupg, lsb-release).

Adds Dockerâ€™s official GPG key.

Sets up Dockerâ€™s stable repository.

Updates the package index again.

Installs Docker Engine, CLI, containerd, Buildx plugin, and Compose plugin.

Adds the current user to the docker group.

Starts and enables the Docker service.

Prints a success message and reminds the user to log out and back in.

# ðŸ“‚ Files
install_docker.sh â€” The main installation script.

# ðŸš€ How to Use
Download the Script

Save the install_docker.sh file to your machine.

Give Execute Permission

Open a terminal where the script is located and run:

bash

chmod +x install_docker.sh
Run the Script

Execute the script:

bash

./install_docker.sh
If needed, you can also run it with sudo:

bash

sudo ./install_docker.sh

# Important:
After running, you must log out and log back in (or reboot) so that group membership changes take effect.
This will allow you to run docker commands without sudo.

# ðŸ§  Detailed Explanation of the Script

# Step	Command	Explanation
1	sudo apt-get update -y	Refreshes the package list.

2	sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release	Installs dependencies needed for Docker.

3	Add GPG key using curl and gpg --dearmor	Secures Docker downloads by verifying authenticity.

4	Setup Docker repository in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list	Tells the system where to find Docker packages.

5	sudo apt-get update -y	Reloads package lists including the new Docker repo.

6	sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin	Installs Docker and its essential components.

7	sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)	Adds your user to the Docker group to avoid using sudo.

8	sudo systemctl start docker and sudo systemctl enable docker	Starts Docker and ensures it starts on reboot.

9	Echo a success message	Informs you that installation completed successfully.

# âš¡ Quick Summary for Explaining
We update the system.

Install some necessary helper tools.

Securely add Docker's key and repository.

Install Docker and Docker plugins.

Allow the current user to run Docker commands without sudo.

Start Docker automatically on system boot.

# ðŸ”” Notes
If Docker was already installed, this will update it.

Always review shell scripts before running them, especially on production servers.

For the group change (usermod), a logout/login (or reboot) is required to take effect.
